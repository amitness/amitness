### 👋 Hi, I'm Amit Chaudhary.

<!--
**amitness/amitness** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently back to grad school pursuing an MS in Computational Linguistics at [CIMEC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en) and [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/overview/PMSCHLTFT-2022-3-O) 
- ✍️ I write [visual explanations](https://amitness.com) of Machine Learning research on my blog
- 🌱 I strongly believe in taking [small steps](https://github.com/amitness/learning) each day to get better at my craft.
